# WaterGuard - Sustainable River Monitoring

**Prototype**: [Figma Prototype - WaterGuard](https://www.figma.com/proto/C9k0XypQb8lyF0XUvR4GYl/WaterGuard?page-id=7002%3A134&node-id=7004-1282&p=f&viewport=25%2C257%2C0.46&t=cSA7XXMehytUKWKK-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed)

## 🏆 Runner-Up at Thomas More Hackathon
WaterGuard is an innovative solution developed during the **Thomas More Hackathon**, organized in collaboration with **Tata Consultancy Services** and **Stad Mechelen**. Our project focuses on **sustainability for the River Dijle in Mechelen**, using autonomous technology to monitor and improve water quality.

## 🌊 Problem Statement
The River Dijle faces pollution and safety risks, making it difficult for citizens to know whether it is safe for activities like **swimming or fishing**. Traditional monitoring methods are slow and inefficient.

## 🚀 Solution - WaterGuard
We developed **an automated system using underwater drones and a real-time data visualization app** to:
- 📊 **Monitor water quality** with real-time data collection.
- 🤖 **Detect hazardous underwater objects** using AI-powered object detection.
- 🗺️ **Provide an interactive map** showing water conditions at different points.
- 🎮 **Encourage engagement** through an educational game where users earn **Mechelenbon credits** for learning about sustainability.

## 🔧 How It Works
1. **Solar-Powered Autonomous Underwater Drones** – These drones collect data hourly and recharge via **solar-powered stations**.
2. **Real-Time Data Processing** – The gathered data is analyzed and displayed in a **user-friendly mobile app**.
3. **AI Object Detection** – Identifies hazardous objects and notifies users and moderators.
4. **Interactive Map** – Users can check water quality at specific locations before swimming or fishing.
5. **Gamification & Rewards** – Users earn points by completing sustainability challenges and redeem them for local eco-friendly rewards.

## 📌 Key Features
- **Live Dashboard**: View aggregated water quality metrics in real-time.
- **AI Object Alerts**: Get notified about potentially dangerous objects detected underwater.
- **Drone Tracking**: See active monitoring locations on a map.
- **Community Engagement**: Learn and earn rewards for participating in sustainability efforts.

## 💡 Tech Stack
- **UI/UX**: Figma
- **Presentation**: PowerPoint

## 🎯 Future Plans
- Expand drone capabilities to detect more environmental threats.
- Collaborate with local authorities for real-world implementation.
- Enhance the AI model for more accurate object detection.

## 🤝 Team WaterGuard
